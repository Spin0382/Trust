//! The web admin panel.
//!
//! An embedded frontend, served through `axum`; a login flow reusing the same account store
//! `/register` and `/login` already use (no second credential system); a live status/console/chat
//! WebSocket; the runtime `panel` console command ([`supervise`]) to toggle this on and off
//! without a restart, and whose real inner task cannot outlive `supervise` itself under any
//! circumstance — see [`PanelHandle`]'s doc comment for the real shutdown bug that guarantee
//! closes; and the full admin feature set: a player list with kick/ban, whitelist
//! management, world switching (a real graceful process restart — see
//! [`crate::game::server::GameServer::pending_world_switch`]'s doc comment for why that is the
//! honest answer rather than a hot-swap), a settings view whose one live-editable field is the
//! MOTD (the game task reads it fresh on every join; see [`settings`]), and a stylized, procedural
//! live world view (see
//! `crates/terrustia/web-panel/src/lib/WorldView.svelte` for the rendering side, and
//! [`worlds::world_ws_upgrade`] for the data it draws from  -  real positions and appearance data,
//! real tile types, never a composited Terraria sprite).
//!
//! **Layout**: this coordinator module owns startup/shutdown ([`run`], [`supervise`],
//! [`PanelHandle`]), shared plumbing every route needs ([`PanelState`], [`ask`], [`err`],
//! [`auth_lookup`], [`send_ws`]), and static asset serving. Each resource has its own sibling
//! module  -  [`auth`] (sessions, login, logout), [`status`] (the status/console socket),
//! [`players`] (players, kick/ban/mute, the whitelist), [`worlds`] (list/switch/generate, the
//! world-view socket), [`settings`] (config, motd, console/chat send, metrics, backups/rollback)
//! and [`accounts`] (accounts, groups, the permission editor, the audit log)  -  each exposing a
//! `router()` this module merges into one. This mirrors `game::server`'s own split into
//! `mod.rs`/`console.rs`/`dispatch.rs`/`panel.rs`/`systems.rs`/`tick.rs`: one coordinator, sibling
//! files by resource.
//!
//! **Bundling**: `rust-embed`'s `axum` feature embeds the built frontend
//! (`crates/terrustia/web-panel/dist/`), served with a catch-all SPA route and an `index.html`
//! fallback for anything that isn't a real asset — the same shape `../alchemist`'s own
//! `src/server/mod.rs` uses (see this crate's `Cargo.toml` for the citation). The `embed-web`
//! cargo feature (on by default) toggles between that and reading straight from disk, for
//! iterating on the frontend without a full `cargo build`.
//!
//! **Off the game task, always.** Every handler here runs on the panel's own tokio task. Nothing
//! it does blocks the game's single-writer actor: reading live state goes through a `ServerEvent`
//! (a channel send and an `.await` on a `oneshot` reply — [`ask`] is the one place that shape is
//! written down, and every handler below reuses it) and the two expensive operations run in a
//! `spawn_blocking` on the panel's own task: argon2, the same discipline
//! `admin::store::Admin::account_hash`'s doc comment requires for player logins, and the audit
//! log's whole-file read ([`accounts::audit_log`], which asks the game task only where the file
//! is).
//!
//! **Every endpoint below `/api/` other than `/api/unclaimed`, `/api/login` and `/api/logout`
//! requires a valid session and its own permission**, checked by [`auth::authorized`] (or
//! [`auth::authorized_token`] for the two WebSocket routes, which carry the session as a `session`
//! query parameter instead of a bearer header  -  a browser cannot attach a custom header to a
//! WebSocket upgrade): a token looked up in [`PanelState::sessions`] to find the signed-in
//! account, then a fresh, per-request check  -  against the game task's live `Admin` store, not
//! anything cached at login  -  that the account's group grants the specific permission that route
//! needs. `login` itself only requires `panel.view` to issue a session at all; a `default` account
//! (which does not hold it) cannot get a session, and a `moderator` one can sign in but still gets
//! `403` from, say, `/api/console`. A session also idles out on its own
//! ([`auth::SESSION_IDLE_TIMEOUT`]), and `/api/logout` ([`auth::router`]) revokes one outright  -
//! see `auth`'s own module doc for both.
//!
//! The two long-lived WebSockets (`status::stream_status`, `worlds::stream_world`) re-run this
//! same check on a timer rather than only once at connect, for the same reason every ordinary
//! route does: a session that expires, is signed out, or has its permissions changed mid-connection
//! must not go on serving a live feed to a credential that would now be refused.
//!
//! Route → permission map (see `admin::group::perm` for what each name actually gates):
//!
//! | route | permission |
//! |---|---|
//! | `/api/status`, `/api/players`, `/api/whitelist` (view), `/api/worlds` (view), `/api/config` (view), `/api/metrics`, `/api/backups`, `/api/worlds/new/status`, `/api/ws`, `/api/ws/world` | `panel.view` |
//! | `/api/console`, `/api/chat` | `panel.console` — a raw line down the same unrestricted channel the sticky console uses |
//! | `/api/players/kick` | `server.kick` |
//! | `/api/players/ban` | `server.ban` |
//! | `/api/players/unban` | `server.unban` |
//! | `/api/players/mute`, `/api/players/unmute` | `server.mute` / `server.unmute` |
//! | `/api/whitelist/add`, `/api/whitelist/remove` | `server.whitelist` |
//! | `/api/config/motd` | `world.motd` |
//! | `/api/worlds/switch` | `world.switch` |
//! | `/api/worlds/new` | `world.new` |
//! | `/api/save` | `world.save` |
//! | `/api/rollback` | `world.rollback` |
//! | `/api/accounts` (view, create, delete) | `admin.accounts` |
//! | `/api/accounts/group` | `admin.accounts`, plus an anti-escalation reach check (see `Admin::group_within_reach`) |
//! | `/api/permissions`, `/api/groups/permissions` | `admin.groups`, the group-permission-set editor — plus, for a grant, the same reach check |
//! | `/api/audit` | `admin.audit` |
//!
//! The rest of the settings view is read-only on purpose, and the panel says so beside each value.
//! The listen socket, the loaded world and the player slot table are all fixed when the process
//! starts, and there is no game-task event for changing the shared join password, so an input for
//! any of them would promise a live change this process cannot make. A new value takes a restart
//! with the config file. Only the MOTD is written live: the game task reads it fresh on every join.
//! An unknown `/api/...` path answers `404` rather than the SPA shell, so a typo or a field this
//! build does not expose fails visibly instead of looking like a successful save.
//!
//! Kick, ban, whitelist and console/chat commands sent from the panel reuse `run_admin_command`'s
//! own logic, or (for raw console/chat lines) `ServerEvent::Console` itself, the very channel the
//! sticky console sends down.
//!
//! **Sessions** are an in-memory map owned by [`auth`], not the account store: a session is a
//! panel-HTTP concern, not core game state, and doesn't need to survive a panel restart.
