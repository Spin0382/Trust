//! The world changing on its own: grass creeping over bare dirt.
//!
//! Terraria runs `WorldGen.UpdateWorld` every tick, sampling random tiles near the players and
//! growing things on them. None of it was here, which made the world permanently static: grass
//! never spread and no biome could be built by hand. Combined with the rest of that loop being
//! absent it also meant nothing was renewable — but grass is the foundation, because herbs and
//! trees both need it underneath them.
//!
//! The rule is `WorldGen.SpreadGrass`: a base tile turns to grass if it is **not sealed in**. The
//! game checks the three-by-three box around it and refuses if every tile in that box is active
//! and solid, which is what stops grass appearing in the middle of solid ground where no light
//! reaches.
//!
//! What spreads is decided by the neighbours, but *which base a grass will spread onto at all* is
//! not the same for every grass — this was the one thing an earlier version of this doc got
//! backwards, claiming "a mud pit could never become a jungle": jungle and mushroom grass grow
//! only on **mud**, never on dirt, so dirt beside jungle grass stays dirt forever. The two evils
//! are the exception that spreads onto both: dirt beside corruption becomes corrupt grass, and mud
//! beside it becomes corrupt *jungle* grass — the block that lets an infection swallow a jungle
//! rather than stopping dead at its edge. That is what lets a player make a biome, and what lets
//! one creep.
