//! The tile-cleanup bundle: six real vanilla passes with a shared theme — mopping up after
//! everything else, rather than placing anything new — bundled the way `plan.md`'s own sizing
//! table already groups them (`TileCleanup`+`QuickCleanup`+`FinalCleanup`+`BrokenTrapCleanup`+
//! `GravitatingSandCleanup`+`SurfaceOreAndStone`+`SurfaceDirtWallsToGrassWalls`, 1,121 lines).
//!
//! **A real finding, not assumed from the sizing table's own "mechanically simple" note**: reading
//! all seven driving passes in full shows most of their bulk is either (a) vanilla's own defensive
//! repair for damage *other* vanilla passes can do to a multi-tile object's frame — chests, the
//! Demon Altar, Shadow Orb, Heart Crystal, all re-normalised from scratch every generation, because
//! some earlier vanilla pass might have left one half-finished — which this project's own placement
//! code has no equivalent need for, since every object here is written with a correct frame at
//! creation and nothing downstream corrupts it; or (b) a genuinely separate, much larger helper
//! function hiding behind a small driving-pass line count (`SurfaceOreAndStone`'s own `OrePatch`/
//! `StonePatch`, ~370 real lines *each*, not counted in the pass's own 66). Both are disclosed in
//! full below, pass by pass, rather than silently dropped.
//!
//! * `GravitatingSandCleanup` (`WorldGen.cs:15210-15239`, 30 lines) — **faithful and complete**.
//! * `QuickCleanup` (`:18002-18122`, 121) — landed narrower: the desert-wall material
//!   normalisation (mud/silt/slush/marble/granite forced to Hardened Sand under a Sandstone or
//!   Hardened Sand wall, and any liquid there forced to lava below the rock layer) and the
//!   degenerate-slope/half-brick cleanup are kept; the ocean liquid-type normalisation (needs
//!   `oceanDepths`/`oceanLevel`, GenVars this generator does not track) and the sand-overhang dig
//!   and wall-continuity fixups (real but genuinely minor/cosmetic) are disclosed-skipped.
//! * `SurfaceOreAndStone` (`:18577-18642`, 66) — landed **much narrower than its own line count
//!   implies**. The driving pass just picks sites; the actual carving is two helper functions
//!   neither counted in the sizing table's 66: `OrePatch` (`:10589-10970`ish, ~370 lines) and
//!   `StonePatch` (`:10218-10589`ish, ~370), each a real elliptical noise-carve — a genuinely
//!   separate, Tier-2-sized siting-and-shaping algorithm, not a small tile scan. Replaced here with
//!   a disclosed, narrower stand-in: a small filled-circle blob of ore or stone at a scanned
//!   surface site, keeping the *effect* (a visible surface outcropping) without porting vanilla's
//!   own noise-carve shape.
//! * `SurfaceDirtWallsToGrassWalls` (`:19752-19847`, 96) — landed narrower: the wall-conversion
//!   half (`Spread.Wall2`, dirt wall near open air near the surface becomes grass wall) is kept;
//!   the tile-conversion half (`SpreadGrass`, dirt tiles near a grass wall turn to grass) needs
//!   `SpreadGrass`'s own general recursive machinery — the same subsystem `moss.rs`'s own module
//!   doc already disclosed skipping for its own closing diffusion step — and is skipped here too.
//! * `TileCleanup` (`:21700-22130`, 431) — landed narrowest of all six: three small, genuinely
//!   load-bearing fixups (a degenerate top-slope-beside-half-brick straighten; liquid forced dry
//!   behind dungeon/temple wall; a `Traps`-tile (137) neighbour half-brick/slope clear) plus the
//!   thin-ice floating-tile cleanup (tile 162, directly relevant to `thin_ice.rs`'s own mechanic).
//!   The rest — a multi-tile frame-renormalisation pass for Shadow Orb/Heart Crystal/chests/the
//!   Demon Altar, and a liquid-drip decoration system (tiles 373-375/709) — is disclosed-skipped
//!   per the module doc's opening paragraph.
//! * `BrokenTrapCleanup` (`:22315-22335`, 21, driving `ClearBrokenTraps`, `:27116-27230`ish, ~115)
//!   — **faithful**: a real wire-circuit flood that clears any wired tile whose circuit does not
//!   contain both a trap and a trigger. `IsItATrap`/`IsItATrigger`'s own real vanilla sets
//!   (`TileID.Sets.Wiring.IsAMechanism`/`IsATrigger`, ~70 and ~10 entries) are narrowed to the
//!   handful of tile types this generator's own `traps.rs`/`wiring.rs` ever actually place — a
//!   disclosed narrowing of the *lookup table*, not the *mechanism*, since every other listed
//!   vanilla tile (banners, Christmas lights, non-generated furniture) can never appear in a world
//!   this generator built in the first place.
//! * `FinalCleanup` (`:22336-22691`, 356) — landed narrower: dungeon-wall liquid dry-out (plus the
//!   real Obsidian-in-dungeon purge), pressure-plate liquid dry-out, the same `Traps`-tile clear
//!   `tile_cleanup` above does (vanilla repeats this fixup in both passes; done once here too, in
//!   `final_cleanup`, to match), a Gold Coin Pile vertical-duplication touch-up, and stray isolated
//!   surface-puddle drainage are kept. Disclosed-skipped: the sand/silt/slush-to-hardened-sand
//!   surface-exposure conversion (a second, more elaborate falling-column simulation distinct from
//!   `GravitatingSandCleanup`'s own), the boulder multi-tile frame-renormalisation-plus-altar-
//!   conflict check, a full-world `TileFrame()` re-frame pass (the same "not needed, this project's
//!   placement code writes correct frames at creation" reasoning as `TileCleanup`'s own cut), the
//!   Desert Fossil easter-egg scatter, every secret-seed finalizer, and the closing full-world
//!   `LiquidCheck` settle pass (this project already settles liquids once, earlier in `build()`,
//!   via `liquid_settle::settle` — see that module's own doc comment).
//!
//! No `StructureMap` dependency anywhere in this bundle — every pass here reshapes or repairs tiles
//! already down, none places a new discrete structure.
