//! The generation record a world file carries, and what it is good for.
//!
//! Every `.wld` ends its header with a JSON manifest: each of the hundred and six generation
//! passes, in the order they ran, and the state of the world's random generator immediately
//! afterwards. The game writes it as a diagnostic. For a port it is something better — an oracle.
//!
//! The game reseeds the generator from the world seed at the start of every pass
//! (`WorldGenerator.cs:499`) and samples it after the pass (`WorldGenerator.cs:515`), so the value
//! recorded after pass N fingerprints the draws of pass N itself. Implement pass N, generate from
//! the same seed, and compare: if it matches, that pass's draw count and order are exactly right,
//! and if it does not, the value names how far off it is. The first value of a pass that draws
//! nothing is the seed's own first draw, which is how a reseeded pass is recognisable in a
//! manifest (the reference world's "Wavy Caves" and "Mud Caves To Grass" both record
//! `143337951`, the first draw for seed 12345).
//!
//! A pass the game was told to skip records no state at all, which is what makes deferring one
//! free rather than fatal: a stub that draws nothing matches a reference generated with that pass
//! disabled, for every pass after it.
//!
//! The reader below is hand-written rather than a JSON library. The shape is fixed and known — a
//! flat array of flat objects with four fields worth having — and this crate's dependency list is
//! short on purpose.
